LIX of Danish Speeches
========
The speeches.csv file contains the LIX of speeches given by the Danish Prime Minister and the Queen of Denmark. LIX is a readability measure indicating the difficulty of reading a text developed by Swedish scholar Carl-Hugo Bj√∂rnsson. It is computed as follows:

LIX = A / B + (C * 100) / A, where

A is the number of word,

B is the number of sentences, and

C is the number of long words (more than 6 letters).
