LIX of Danish Speeches
========
The speeches.csv file contains the LIX of speeches given by the Danish Prime Minister January the 1st and when opening the Danish Parliament and the Queen of Denmark New Year's Eve. LIX is a measure of how difficult a text is to understand developed by Swedish scholar Carl-Hugo Bj√∂rnsson. It is computed as follows:

LIX = A / B + (C * 100) / A, where

A is the number of word,

B is the number of sentences, and

C is the number of long words (more than 6 letters).
